# Reverse Linked List Debugging Exercise
Created by Kevin Allen for practicing debugging using VS Code and/or GitHub Codespaces.

## Disclaimer
The provided question solution ReverseLLSolution.cpp is set up to test against a single test case for the Reverse Linked List problem where the input is the singly linked list 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 and correct output is 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1. I do not guarantee that this solution would cover all possible input edge cases.

## Files Provided
There are four files provided for this exercise: 
- ReverseLLDebugging.cpp: Reference to initial ReverseLLToDebug.cpp with all bugs
- ReverseLLToDebug.cpp: File to debug/modify while completing exercise
- ReverseLLSolution.cpp: Reference to solution that is fully debugged
- bugs.txt: lists where the bugs are if you are getting stuck and need some extra help

## Instructions
1. Make a GitHub Codespace (Code -> Codespaces -> + sign) or clone repository to local machine and open in local VS Code
2. Open ReverseLLToDebug.cpp within VS Code
3. On the left sidebar, Run & Debug, then click the main button, then select g++ - build and debug active file for build type
   - If you are not using Codespaces and do not have g++ installed locally, see the following link for help: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw
4. Then the code should build, start running with debugger, and show any compiler errors
5. Identify and fix any compiler errors
6. Then set a breakpoint at main, begin debugging, identify and fix logic bugs, and repeat! Good luck!
