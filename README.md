# Reverse Linked List Debugging Exercise
Created by Kevin Allen for practicing debugging using VS Code and GitHub Codespaces.

## Disclaimer
The provided question solution ReverseLLSolution.cpp is set up to test against a single test case for the Reverse Linked List problem where the input is the singly linked list 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 and correct output is 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1. I do not guarantee that this solution would cover all possible input edge cases.

## Files Provided
There are four files provided for this exercise: ReverseLLDebugging.cpp, ReverseLLToDebug.cpp, ReverseLLSolution.cpp, and bugs.txt. The file that you should use the VS Code debugging with and modify is ReverseLLToDebug.cpp. ReverseLLDebugging.cpp is meant to be a reference to the initial buggy state of the solution and ReverseLLSolution is meant to be a reference to the fully debugged solution. bugs.txt is a text file that describes where the bugs are in case you are getting stuck and need some extra help.
