# Reverse Linked List Debugging Exercise
Created by Kevin Allen for practicing debugging using VS Code and GitHub Codespaces.

## Disclaimer
The provided question solution ReverseLLSolution.cpp is set up to test against a single test case for the Reverse Linked List problem where the input is the singly linked list 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 and correct output is 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1. I do not guarantee that this solution would cover all possible input edge cases.

## Files Provided
There are four files provided for this exercise: 
- ReverseLLDebugging.cpp: Reference to initial ReverseLLToDebug.cpp with all bugs
- ReverseLLToDebug.cpp: File to debug/modify while completing exercise
- ReverseLLSolution.cpp: Reference to solution that is fully debugged
- bugs.txt: lists where the bugs are if you are getting stuck and need some extra help
